- Sample Reports not printing QRDR correct
- Final Report not working


- unicycler uses a default of 8 threads -> need to control with the process or fix at 1
    - better to expose option of "max threads per process / max threads total" ??
- need to check other tools for default threads & probably explicity fix them to 1 (or enable threading control)
- amrfinder / mlst not part of the conda repo
- amrfinder doesn't download database after first use
    - run `amrfinder -u` when it downloads the refs?
- freebayes SNP qual of 30 is quite low, why so low?
- kraken hardcoded to 16 threads
